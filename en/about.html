		<article><h1>Why am I doing this?</h1><br/>
		<p class="contenido">Well, I do this for practice, I have interest to learn deploying webpages: the front-end and the back-end, in this site you will find experiments with the CSS format, HTML 5, JavaScript apps and their derivates, even some exercises with PHP. Also, I have a <del>not so</del> hidden objective: learn to program a lot of things effectively, this is because today is inconceivable be an electronic engineer (actually, engineer in anything) and do not know programming. So it won't be rare to find here C++ algorithms (just for starting), little Verilog projects to config a FPGA circuit, with the addition of digital circiuits designs. In conclusion, you will see lots and lots of programming work. Even for review, there it will be SPICE circuits simulations just for remerber the now forgotten circuits theory, a little mental exercise with the scope of detoxing me from so much <del>bullshit</del> foolishness that distracts me in the Internet.</p>
		<p class="contenido">And if there wasn't enough, the practice of various languages is included between my goals: I live in Portugal, and it's very important to learn the language where you are living (obvious, isn't?). Also the English language, that it's a mandatory language to learn and practice - specially if you want to live off the technology- and, dust off the Italian language, my parent's language, all in the same site!. Please I ask for patience if the publications are only (temporarily) in the Spanish language: it's my mother language and the one that I can "work" quickly my personal project (who says if in a future I can take benefit of this) but I assure you that later or sooner you will find the article in the other languages.</p><br/>
